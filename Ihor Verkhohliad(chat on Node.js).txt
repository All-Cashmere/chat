For start you need: 
	- installed and started mongodb
	- installed node.js (+ npm)
	- installed git

Start: 
	- git clone https://github.com/ihorek7777/chat.git 
	- cd chat 
	- npm install
	- npm start

P.S. 
	I am sorry, I could not upload it on heroku(free hosting), I had a trouble with monogdb on cloud.
	So it can start only on local server with started server of mongodb.
